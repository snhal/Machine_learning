Practice web scraping and analyze the scraped data with linear regression.
1) Scrape tripadvisor hotel data with python BeautifulSoup. Scrape basic hotel information in this format - hotel_name, star_rating, count. Save the data in traveller_ratings.csv.
2) Scrape hotel reviews for certain attributes. These attributes are - value, location, sleep quality, rooms, cleanliness and service. For each review, scrape the star value for attributes in this format - hotel_name, review_id, attribute, star_value. Save the data in attribute_ratings.csv.
3) Fit a linear regression model on the scraped data to predict the average rating for each hotel.
